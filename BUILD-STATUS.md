## Current Phase: 1a — Recording Pipeline

## Build Chunks

### Chunk 1: Scaffold + Core Pipeline (P1a.0-6)
| Bead | Status | Score | Notes |
|------|--------|-------|-------|
| P1a.0 | NOT STARTED | - | MCPB research blocker — do before Phase 2 |
| P1a.1 | DONE | 10/10 | Cargo workspace: `core` (lib) + `cli` (bin). 10 modules in core. |
| P1a.2 | PLACEHOLDER | 4/10 | Creates placeholder WAV. Real cpal+BlackHole capture not yet wired. Next priority. |
| P1a.3 | DONE | 10/10 | WAV writing via hound. Temp WAV cleanup on pipeline completion. |
| P1a.4 | DONE | 10/10 | **whisper-rs + symphonia integrated.** Real transcription working on M4 Max (146ms for 3s audio). Format conversion: m4a/mp3/ogg/wav. Feature flag for test builds without model. 5 new unit tests. |
| P1a.5 | DONE | 10/10 | Markdown writer: YAML frontmatter, 0600 perms, collision handling, memo/meeting templates, no-speech marker. 5 tests. |
| P1a.6 | DONE | 9/10 | CLI: record, stop, status, search, list, process, setup, logs. PID lifecycle. Signal handling (Ctrl-C). JSON output for MCPB. Missing: real audio capture blocks full 10/10. |

### Chunk 2: Config + Infrastructure (P1a.7-8, P1a.14-15)
| Bead | Status | Score | Notes |
|------|--------|-------|-------|
| P1a.7 | DONE | 10/10 | Config with compiled-in defaults, optional TOML file, partial merge. 4 tests. |
| P1a.8 | PARTIAL | 5/10 | `minutes setup --list` works. Actual model download not implemented (prints manual instructions). |
| P1a.14 | DONE | 8/10 | logging.rs: JSON line append, log rotation (7 days), log_step/log_error helpers. `minutes logs` CLI command. Missing: pipeline doesn't call log_step yet (uses tracing only). |
| P1a.15 | NOT STARTED | - | Test fixtures (5s WAV, mock data) — defer to P1a.16 edge case pass |

### Chunk 3: Watcher + Voice Memos (P1a.11-13, P1a.12)
| Bead | Status | Score | Notes |
|------|--------|-------|-------|
| P1a.11 | DONE | 9/10 | Folder watcher: notify event loop, settle delay, lock file, move to processed/failed, skip processed/failed subdirs, process existing files on start. 10 tests. Missing: real whisper transcription (uses placeholder). |
| P1a.12 | DONE | 10/10 | Memo frontmatter: `type: memo`, `source: voice-memo`, `status: transcript-only/no-speech`. Separate memos/ subdirectory. |
| P1a.13 | NOT STARTED | - | Apple Shortcut (.shortcut file) — needs manual creation in Shortcuts app |

### Chunk 4: Polish + Edge Cases (P1a.9-10, P1a.16)
| Bead | Status | Score | Notes |
|------|--------|-------|-------|
| P1a.9 | DONE | 9/10 | README.md with install, usage, config, Claude integration sections. LICENSE (MIT). Missing: CONTRIBUTING.md. |
| P1a.10 | DONE | 10/10 | Git repo initialized, main branch, 2 commits. GitHub repo creation pending (needs `gh repo create`). |
| P1a.16 | DONE | 9/10 | 8 integration tests: full pipeline (meeting + memo), empty audio, permissions, collision, search filter, auto-create dir, nonexistent file. Missing: edge case unit tests for logging rotation, search special chars. |

## Chunk Gates
- [x] Chunk 1 gate: `minutes record` → `minutes stop` → markdown file appears (with placeholder transcription)
- [x] Chunk 2 gate: `minutes setup --list` works, logging module built, 41 tests pass
- [x] Chunk 3 gate: `minutes process` on .wav → markdown in memos/ (watcher module built, tested)
- [x] Chunk 4 gate: `cargo test` (41 pass), `cargo clippy` clean, `cargo fmt` clean

## Remaining for 10/10 on all beads
- P1a.2: Replace placeholder with real cpal + BlackHole audio capture
- P1a.8: Implement actual model download from HuggingFace
- P1a.13: Create Apple Shortcut (.shortcut file)
- P1a.14: Wire pipeline to call log_step() (currently tracing only)
- P1a.15: Add dedicated 5s WAV test fixture (currently using hound-generated fixtures)

## What's buildable now
- `cargo build` — compiles clean
- `cargo test` — 41 tests pass (33 unit + 8 integration)
- `cargo clippy -- -D warnings` — clean
- `cargo fmt --check` — clean
- `minutes record` — creates placeholder WAV, Ctrl-C transcribes + saves markdown
- `minutes process <file>` — processes any WAV through pipeline
- `minutes search <query>` — searches meeting files
- `minutes list` — lists all meetings/memos
- `minutes status` — shows recording status (JSON)
- `minutes watch` — watches folder for new audio files
- `minutes setup --list` — shows available whisper models

## Resume Instructions (for post-compaction)
1. Read this file to see current status
2. Read PLAN.md for task details and architecture decisions
3. Read CLAUDE.md for project conventions
4. Check `cargo build` status
5. Continue from the first NOT STARTED or IN PROGRESS bead
