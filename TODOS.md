# TODOS.md — Minutes

## ~~P1: Agent Memory SDK (TypeScript)~~ DONE
**Shipped:** 2026-03-24. `minutes-sdk@0.7.1` on npm with README, usage examples (Vercel AI SDK, LangChain), `defaultDir()`, `listVoiceMemos()`, `findDecisions()`. 7 exported functions + 5 types.

## ~~P2: Claude Code Plugin Standalone Distribution~~ DONE
**Shipped:** 2026-03-24. Marketplace manifest at `.claude-plugin/marketplace.json`, plugin manifest at `.claude/plugins/minutes/.claude-plugin/plugin.json`. Install: `claude plugin marketplace add silverstein/minutes && claude plugin install minutes`.

## P3: Open Source Interactive Skill Template
**What:** Extract the multi-phase interactive skill pattern into a reusable SKILL-TEMPLATE-INTERACTIVE.md that other Claude Code plugin authors can follow.
**Why:** Positions Minutes as the reference implementation for great Claude Code plugin skills. Community multiplier.
**Pros:** Low effort, high community impact. Documents patterns that would otherwise live only in our heads.
**Cons:** Template may need revision as patterns evolve. Premature extraction risk if patterns aren't battle-tested.
**Context:** Deferred from interactive skills ecosystem CEO review (2026-03-19). Extract after the interactive skills have been used for 2-4 weeks and the patterns are proven.
**Effort:** S (human: ~1 day / CC: ~15 min)
**Depends on:** Interactive skills being battle-tested (2-4 weeks of usage).

## P2: Weekly Synthesis as First-Class Recall Panel View
**What:** Add a "Weekly" phase to the Recall panel that renders the weekly synthesis directly, rather than only running as a CLI skill in the terminal.
**Why:** Completes the lifecycle loop (prep → record → debrief → weekly) in the UI. Currently `/minutes weekly` runs in the terminal but the output isn't visually distinct from a regular conversation.
**Pros:** Full lifecycle coverage in one surface. Panel header shows "Weekly — Mar 10-14" with the synthesis.
**Cons:** Needs a way to distinguish "weekly view" from regular terminal output — may need richer rendering beyond raw xterm.
**Context:** Deferred from Recall panel CEO review (2026-03-19). Ship the base panel first, then evaluate whether weekly deserves a distinct rendering mode.
**Effort:** M (human: ~1 week / CC: ~30 min)
**Depends on:** Recall panel shipping.

## P3: Multi-Thread Conversations (Per-Meeting Chat History)
**What:** Instead of one singleton PTY session, each meeting gets its own conversation thread. Switching to a different meeting in the Recall panel loads that meeting's conversation history.
**Why:** Currently, context-switching via CURRENT_MEETING.md gives Claude the context, but the terminal scroll buffer from the previous meeting is still visible. Per-meeting threads would give clean separation.
**Pros:** You can return to a meeting discussion days later with full context.
**Cons:** Major architectural change — either multiple PTY sessions or a conversation persistence layer. Breaks the singleton model. May need hybrid approach beyond raw xterm.js.
**Context:** Deferred from Recall panel CEO review (2026-03-19). Evaluate after panel usage shows whether users actually want to revisit past meeting conversations.
**Effort:** L (human: ~2 weeks / CC: ~2 hours)
**Depends on:** Recall panel + usage data on whether users need per-meeting threads.

## ~~P3: Publish to crates.io~~ DONE
**Shipped:** 2026-03-24. `minutes-core@0.7.0` + `minutes-cli@0.7.0` published. `cargo install minutes-cli` works on all platforms.

## P3: WASM compilation of minutes-reader for SDK
**What:** Compile `minutes-reader` (Rust crate, no audio deps) to WASM and use it as the npm SDK's parsing core instead of the TypeScript reimplementation.
**Why:** Eliminates TS/Rust parsing divergence, guarantees exact parity with the Rust pipeline, leverages battle-tested Rust code with existing tests.
**Context:** Eureka moment from eng review (2026-03-22). The `minutes-reader` crate was designed with no audio dependencies — it's a clean WASM target. Only matters when the TS SDK has real users and parsing edge cases surface.
**Effort:** M (human: ~1 week / CC: ~30 min)
**Depends on:** SDK shipping + user feedback on parsing edge cases.

## P2: Real-Time Streaming Whisper for Dictation
**What:** Replace batch whisper (transcribe after silence) with streaming whisper — text appears progressively as the user speaks. Feed audio chunks to whisper in ~2-second rolling windows with segment stitching to produce continuous output.
**Why:** The single biggest UX upgrade to dictation. Transforms the experience from "speak, wait 2s, see text" to "text appears as you speak" (WisprFlow/Monologue parity). The streaming.rs + VAD infra is already built — this is the whisper layer on top.
**Pros:** Dramatically more responsive dictation. Makes dictation feel like a real text input method rather than a batch processor. Builds directly on existing AudioStream + VAD.
**Cons:** Segment stitching is complex (whisper can re-transcribe overlapping audio differently). Needs careful handling of partial results vs. final results. Higher CPU usage from continuous whisper inference.
**Context:** Identified as highest-leverage follow-up during dictation CEO review (2026-03-23). Ship Dictation Lite (batch) first, then upgrade to streaming based on usage feedback.
**Effort:** L (human: ~3 weeks / CC: ~3-4 hours)
**Depends on:** Dictation Lite shipping first. Model preload pattern from dictation.rs provides the foundation.

## ~~P2: Cross-Device Dictation (Phone → Mac Pipeline)~~ DONE
**Shipped:** 2026-03-24. Duration-based routing in watch.rs, sidecar JSON metadata, iCloud stub filtering, VoiceMemoProcessed events, SessionStart hook with recent memos, `recent_ideas` MCP resource, `/minutes ideas` skill. See `docs/designs/cross-device-ghost-context.md`.

## P2: Full Ambient Memory (Voice Memo Intelligence)
**What:** Upgrade voice memo pipeline with LLM auto-classification (person, project, topic tags), intent/decision extraction on voice memos, and include voice memos in `/minutes weekly` synthesis alongside meetings.
**Why:** Transforms voice memos from "searchable text" to "intelligent entries" that Claude can reason about structurally. The ghost context layer (Approach B) establishes the capture pipeline; this adds the intelligence layer on top.
**Pros:** Voice memos become first-class meeting intelligence. Auto-tagging eliminates manual organization. Weekly synthesis surfaces cross-memo patterns.
**Cons:** LLM classification adds latency (~2-5s per memo) and cost. May be overkill for very short memos (<15s). Needs careful prompt engineering to avoid over-extraction.
**Context:** Deferred as Approach C during cross-device ghost context CEO review (2026-03-24). The foundation (Approach B: duration routing + sidecar metadata + ghost context) must ship first.
**Effort:** L (human: ~3 weeks / CC: ~3-4 hours)
**Depends on:** Cross-device ghost context layer shipping first (Approach B).

## P3: Create DESIGN.md
**What:** Formalize the implicit design system (CSS variables, component patterns, typography, spacing, color usage) into a DESIGN.md file.
**Why:** The codebase has a strong implicit design language in the CSS but no documentation. As the UI grows (Recall panel, future features), having a reference prevents drift.
**Pros:** Single source of truth for all design decisions. Makes design reviews faster. Prevents contributors from introducing conflicting visual patterns.
**Cons:** Maintenance overhead — must be updated when CSS changes.
**Context:** Deferred from Recall panel design review (2026-03-19). Extract from existing CSS variables + the new Recall panel patterns. Include: color tokens, typography scale, spacing scale, radius values, component patterns (pills, badges, buttons, overlays, bars), animation timing curves.
**Effort:** S (human: ~2 hours / CC: ~15 min)
**Depends on:** Recall panel implementation (new patterns should be included).
